Australia is going through a transitional period. It used to be the young western nation, trying hard to keep up with the bigger brothers and sisters, yet in recent times Australia has matured to the point that it even surpasses some of the older nations in aspects of multiculturalism, social security, health, etc. Unfortunately whilst the country has matured, the government has not. Governments of Australia continue to label itself as the 'deputy sheriff' of the region, happy to ride on the coat tails of the larger more established western empires.

Yet the detriment of lacking a bold vision for Australia is that the people will not learn how to aspire to greatness. China has actively developed its own space program, something which its people can and should be very proud of. Where is Australia's space program? Too expensive? Oh the USA has already has an established program so we don't even consider it? Unfortunately Australia is facing some tough challenges ahead as it matures to becoming a truly independent state that others may look to as an equal rather than a nation that just follows the leader.
