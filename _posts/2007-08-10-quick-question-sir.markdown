I'm sure everyone is familiar with the credit card salesmen that hang out in shopping centres these days. Standing in front of their little stall and calling out to random passers-by, trying to lure them into a sales pitch. Or maybe the people that come knocking on your door selling heavily discounted newspaper subscriptions are more familiar. Either way, you cannot escape the aggressive sales tactics that so plague modern society.

Did it all start with snake oil? Perhaps not, but that is probably the most apt analogy to the strategies employed today by the traveling salesmen. *Rule of Sales #1: Have belief in the product you are selling, or at least appear to have belief in it.* Maybe it is the sheer proliferation of people trying to make a quick buck, but I think many salespeople these days haven't quite nailed this one. I can't remember the last time I spoke to someone that was trying to sell me something they actually would buy for themselves (apart from electronic gadgets - I think we all marvel at what technology can do these days). No, these days sales experience is a commodity that you can (apparently) apply to anything and expect success. This is why credit card companies and newspaper corporations are all willing to outsource their sales to some generic reseller that will flog off a product using their generic sales skills.

Have the outsourcers considered that the aversion of the general public to these sales tactics may in fact translate to bad publicity for the product? Probably. In fact they have probably found that people don't hold a grudge for too long, and as they say, there's no such thing as bad publicity. *Rule of Sales #2: Everything can be sold, as long as the price is right.* Heavily discounted subscription fees, waive the annual fee for the first year, the first hit is free. Sure it may be a bargain to someone, but if you don't need it - or even want or have a use for it - chances are that it isn't the bargain you bargained for.

So anyway, sure it's a free world and salesmen - like everyone - have a right to earn a living doing what they do - after all they are [just doing their job]. But is it really a necessary job? Is it making our world a better place? Or are they like mosquitoes - something you probably wouldn't miss if they were to become extinct tomorrow.

So to you, Mr. Salesman, Sir, I have a quick question: Do you actually like your job? Do you get satisfaction from selling things to people that they probably don't need? *Rule of Sales #3: There is a better salesman than you somewhere in the world, and they are probably the one that sold your job to you. *
