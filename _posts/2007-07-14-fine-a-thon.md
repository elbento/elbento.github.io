Well I was hoping I wouldn't be posting again quite so soon, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised..

Today I had to run down to the travel agent to pick up something for my sister. As per usual I'm not running early, so I don't have a lot of time to get down there. Parking is a nightmare on Saturday morning, so I have to park in a ticketed area (parking on the street is timed, but free). The ticketed area is ten (10) metres from the travel agent, so I decide to risk not buying a ticket and run in to get what I need. Yes I know, alarm bells should have been ringing, considering my [last encounter], but in the interests of social experimentation I decided to try my luck.

So I get into the travel agent and the guy is dealing with another customer. I don't listen too intently, but I suspect the deal has been done and they are just haggling about how far they can push the deadlines for paying deposits and the full amount for their holiday. So I wait - not all that long, probably ten (10) minutes - and promptly receive what I came for. I rush back out to the car, look on the windscreen, and sure enough I see a parking ticket. This time it is $55, which, compared to the last fine, seems reasonable. Or maybe I am still numbed by the last fine and can't really be bothered even worrying about it. "Yeah whatever, add it to the list".

So I'm thinking I might need some kind of corporate sponsorship for my day to day activities. Perhaps I could offer some advertising space on the back of my head: "This life brought to you by [lifeminders.com] - we'll keep you out of trouble!".
