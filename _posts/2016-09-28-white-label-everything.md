Many industries are in the midst of a disruptive period due to the efficiencies realised by technology, the Internet, and a push towards
automation. Organisations that are structured to control the entire supply chain are no longer profitable in the face of change and are
scrambling to identify new revenue streams to prop up their antiquated business models.

Journalism is surely suffering from this problem, with many media organisations shedding costs (and employees) as fast as they can, looking
for ways to transform themselves before they collapse unde the weight of history. Unfortunately most media organisations think they need to
reinvent themselves as a social media organisation to remain relevant, however it is difficult to see how such a transformation will
magically solve their revenue concerns. The changes required for these organisations are much more fundamental, and ultimately they need to
think beyond the the traditional revenue raiser of consumer advertising.

Media organisations offer a wealth of expertise and services required to maintain the highest levels of journalism. They must capitalise on
this wealth by providing their services to the new wave of media companies in a form of "white-label" journalism.
