Google recently announced that they are retiring their feed reader service due to declining usage and realignment of focus on products that generate profit. Ultimately it seems that Reader does not fit in the current 'walled garden' philosophy being applied to all the big social networking platforms (i.e. Google+, Facebook, Twitter). Perhaps less so with Twitter, but it seems that Facebook and Google+ would like you to stay within their confines as long as possible. But contrary to rhetoric, these walled gardens are not necessarily beneficial to the users of these services, but rather are attempts to maximise advertising revenue by taking browsers hostage - an approach we have seen since the early days of the web where sites would use frames to keep browser traffic going through their sites.

The problem with these All Of Internet sites is that they dismiss the potential for mashups, or combining different sites and web resources to make new sites and resources. Yahoo Pipes is a good example of a service that provides mashups for RSS feeds, and whilst it may not have been a raging success it does set the stage for more services that are open and accessible without first having to sell your soul.

Google says Reader's problem was declining usage, however it is hard to believe that Google couldn't afford to maintain the status quo without being concerned with profit-making. Unfortunately it seems they are yet another example of an organisation that has been infiltrated by bean counters - and bean counters will always destroy what is great, before they move on to their next target..
