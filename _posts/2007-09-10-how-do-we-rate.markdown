Recently I have noticed  a significant increase in the number of email surveys I am receiving. Regardless of the industry - from health insurance to charities - it seems that practically anyone that has my email address wants me to complete an online survey about myself, their current services or potential future services. I guess it seems like a reasonable way to gather information about your customer base, and I probably wouldn't mind so much if these surveys weren't so excruciatingly boring!

Which I guess is why they tend to offer prizes as incentive to complete the survey. But here's a cheaper option guys - figure out how to make a survey short and to the point and you'll find more people will do it for nothing. As it currently stands, if I have to read a page more than once (usually due to a bad layout), there are more than three (3) questions to a page, or there are more than five (5) pages, chances are that I won't finish your survey. Now if I, as a Gen-X/Yer (somewhere in between - I still don't get these classifications!) cannot concentrate on your survey, then the *ADD* generation to follow will have no hope whatsoever.

And whilst the number of booths in shopping malls trying to [sell you something] are steadily increasing, their numbers are dwarfed by the proliferation of people with clipboards asking for a moment of your time to do a survey. Even if I had the time to spare for a survey, these days I just wouldn't do it for fear that if they get my name and address there's a good chance I'll end up on yet another spammers list somewhere.

Because that is the way it works. The more cooperative you are in sharing information the more likely you are to be punished - harassed no less - either by phone, fax, email or snail mail. So the lesson we (eventually) learn is don't trust your details to anyone unless you have no other choice. But even then you will not be able to completely avoid the harassment we all must experience.
