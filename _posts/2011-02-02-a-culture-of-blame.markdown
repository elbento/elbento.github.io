It seems not so long ago that we used to look at the litigious nature of American society with bemusement. Not only did people refuse to accept responsibility for their own actions, but they also felt a need to find someone to blame for events that are out of everyone's control.

We no longer find this attitude so alien in Australia, with the ruthless search for people, organisations and governments that we can find guilty as charged. With an unprecedented season of natural disasters, we are seeing tremendous community spirit - people pulling together to help each other in the face of adversity. But for the media there is only so much news to sell about goodwill: finding the guilty parties is much more lucrative.

But who is to blame for natural disasters? Can we charge God with being insensitive? Whilst it may not be politically correct to cast doubt on God's will, politicians are certainly fair game. Was there enough warning? Did the government do enough to protect the public? If the police advise evacuation in advance but people refuse to heed the warning, is it really the fault of the public services if there is injury or loss of life as a result? Surely we don't need to ask these questions - we all make our own choices each and every day, and we value a society that allows us to do so. Why then do we try to blame someone else for our own poor judgement?

And what about the cost - will they force us to foot the bill for the damage that we are not responsible for? If we are altruistic enough to actually donate some money to those in need, any additonal levies should be offset by the tax deductibility of the donation. But of course the people that complain the loudest are also the ones that are the least likely to be altruistic.

But of course the media will hype anything that generates fear, uncertainty and doubt in people's minds, and a natural disaster brings all of these with it. Perhaps however the doubt should be cast on the real benefits of such a media, and whether a world without it would be a more forgiving and compassionate one.
