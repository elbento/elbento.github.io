[Sarah] recently posted about a [troubling scene] where bystanders jeered at a motorist in the wrong place. I am witness to such events on a daily basis - not quite as blatant but similarly disturbing. Usually related to pedestrian traffic, and usually involving public transport.

A sigh, or a grunt, even a look of disgust at people not following to explicit or implicit rules. I must admit I am guilty myself of getting annoyed when people don't move down the carriage and block the doorway on trams and trains.

These are afflictions of an increasingly segmented life. Time-box everything to the nth degree. It allows two things: 1. Operate on auto-pilot - no need to think about routine tasks, we can instead peer into our smart phones at twitter, facebook, news feeds, etc. 2. Improve the efficiency of the well-oiled machine, eliminate gaps, delays, interruptions to our momentum.

Public transport operators have a reason to act this way: they have SLAs to meet and if they run late they get penalised - evident in the recent Footscray station debacle where getting the train moving was more important than the safety of a sick/injured passenger. We can't really expect anything more from an organisation, which has emphasis only on efficiency and profit, not on ethical values and moralistic behaviour.

Many believe we need to change our organisations to act more ethically, with a conscience. But perhaps, in reality, it is organisations that are changing us. We are losing our compassion for others in our increasingly mechanistic behaviour, replacing moral thought with concern only for meeting our own personal SLAs.
