Marketing is the cornerstone of every product or service in a modern society. Branding, slogans, product placement; all of these techniques contribute to promoting awareness in the marketplace. More recently however, in a desperate attempt to stay relevant in an increasingly connected world, we see marketing strategies becoming more and more deceitful.

It is not uncommon for a marketing budget to exceed that of a product's entire development, highlighting the importance that companies place on promotion. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the amount spent on marketing is often directly proportional to the inverse of the product's true value, i.e. the more useless a product is the more it will be flogged off to consumers.

So what then,  is the real purpose of this marketing machine modern society has created? Is it to promote the real benefits a product will bring to our lives, or is it just a mechanism for fooling us into parting with our wealth for something that, more often than not, is simply a waste of our time and money?

But marketing is not entirely without its benefits as, used wisely it can help to [gauge public opinion] about the true benefits of a product or service, and so help to measure if we really are on the right path or just cluttering the market with yet more snake oil.
