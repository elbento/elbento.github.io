  content: Bravo! Well articulated. You were extremely generous to gloss over detail
    about the inexcusable inefficiencies and deterioration of the public transport
    system. Let's not even get into the necessity of an effective public transport
    system if we are to reduce green house gas emissions and deal with rapid population
    growth in Melbourne. When public transport is at its least effective they are
    jacking up the prices and increasing the number of inspectors (who are very well
    trained in being free of compassion). Makes my blood boil just thinking about
    it. Paying a premium for a failing system!

    Wouldn't you stand on the left hand side of an escalator. We drive on the left hand side. Shouldn't other modes of transport adopt the same convention.

    By the way.. a budget is a good thing.

Case study of a broken system 1:

Every week I use Melbourne's public transport system to get to and from work. Depending on the location of the work, I will typically use the train or tram network. Public transport in Melbourne is not free, and the governing bodies spend millions of dollars every year making sure you are aware of that fact. Despite this, there have always been, and I suspect always will be, mechanisms to avoid paying for use of this system.

As a financially-deprived university student I may have been known to take advantage of these mechanisms from time to time, typically as a means to afford some kind of social life at least on par with the dead. However, against all odds I managed to serve my sentence of poverty and emerged the other side into a well-paying career. With my new-found wealth I no longer had a need to avoid paying for public transport, and as such have made every reasonable effort to do the right thing. Unfortunately this is not enough.

This morning I realised my weekly ticket had expired. I had no coins to buy a ticket on the tram (they ONLY accept coins, and if you don't have any, tough luck!), so I decided I would catch the tram to work anyway and buy a ticket when I got there. As luck would have it, inspectors boarded my tram and started checking tickets. I explained my situation and showed them my weekly ticket that had only just expired. Naturally he pulls out his pad. "Do you know what I am doing?". "Are you going to fine me?". "No, I am just reporting the incident". You can just imagine the think tanks that come up with the scripts these guys spout: "What words can we use that will defuse an inflammatory situation?". I suspect they are the same guys that governments use to come up with terms like "Unlawful Combatants", or "[Collateral Damage]". Anyone with half a brain will recognise such doublespeak as an insult to their intelligence.


"You know it's my job to make sure people have a valid ticket". Sure. Is it not also your job to use your brain to assess the situation and decide if someone actually deserves to be fined? The police are capable of giving warnings all the time, how is this any different?
"Do you understand what just happened?". "Are you going to fine me?". "I will report the incident. If you get a letter in the mail from the Department of Infrastructure then yes you will be fined $158". Wow, thanks for being so honest with me.

So I guess this is the price you pay for not paying attention to detail. I don't have a budget. I don't know exactly how much I am paid every week, or how much interest I earn from my investments. I don't know how much I have in my super. I haven't done tax for a couple of years. I don't catch the same tram/train to/from work. I don't sit in the same seat when I do. I don't time my journeys, so I am sometimes late. I sometimes run out of milk. Finding insurance of any kind is a mind-numbing chore to me. I don't abuse people that don't stand on the ~~right~~ left on escalators.

And of course, I don't always keep track of dates..

So I guess this system is just not meant for me. I relish the day that I no longer depend on public transport. It is a sad fact, especially when we should all be considering it more and more. Ultimately it seems, to lead an existence focused on the meaningful things, as opposed to an anally retentive focus on the meaningless, is a privilege that will cost extra.
